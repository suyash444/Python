# --- Tuples are immutable means the values cannot be neither changed


# -- tuple is like a list but in tuple we cannot change the values as the tuples are immutable and whereas lists are mutable..

# why we use tuples?

# you have a list provided and you dont want to change the values of the list then you will go with the tup[les
# as iteration  in tuples are faster and if we want to enhance the execution speed we will go with the tuples.


#  [] ---- square brackets are used for lists
#  ()---- Round brackets are used for Tuples
#  {}---- curly brackets are used for Sets


# sets use curly brackets and in sets no sequence is defined as it gives the numbers in random as
# it uses hash algorithm to give the numbers quickly and in sets no repetion will be there only
# one value will be printed once


# sets
s={12, 122, 1 ,3 ,98,12}
print(s)

# Tuples
a =(1,2,4,5,6,6,6)
print(a.count(6))

# count -- it will count how many time that 4 appeared in the tuples
